# arm64-base

## About

This machine is a base install for the arm64 architecture. (Likely) if you are
building Gentoo Build Publisher machines from an x86 architecture you will
require [qemu and binfmt
configured](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Embedded_Handbook/General/Compiling_with_qemu_user_chroot).
Otherwise it should just work. Be prepared for long build times.
